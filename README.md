# Massively parallel Fibonacci

You are tasked with calculating the first 100000 fibonacci sequence numbers as fast as possible.
There is no *correct* way to solve to this problem. Abuse tokio, rayon, `std::thread`, channels, atomics, and whatever you think is the right tool for the job!   

The only requirement is that the sequence is mathematically accurate!   

There is an included criterion benchmark for your performance testing needs.
